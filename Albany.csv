Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance.<br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques.
